# FabWeave Operations Lab

FabWeave is a dependency-light Python reference project for semiconductor-fab
operations.  Its production modules model queue-time protection, dispatch,
reticle reservations, recipe qualification, SPC, metrology sampling,
maintenance, chamber matching, holds, genealogy, chemical aging, cleanroom
excursions, demand control, rework, lot merging, equipment dedication,
contamination, takt, route yield, yield-excursion containment and shipment
commitments.

The cross-domain workflow layer composes these services for material
readiness, dispatch-after-hold, qualified reservations and assignments,
metrology/SPC gates, genealogy and yield-excursion containment, powered
scheduling, rework release, merge-to-commit and performance reporting.  It
preserves domain rejection reasons instead of replacing them with a generic
success or failure.

Shared infrastructure supplies half-open time intervals, versioned policy
history, immutable decisions, quantity conservation and an append-only event
log with optimistic concurrency.  Domain services use these primitives to keep
event-time, idempotency and fail-closed behavior consistent.

Run the tests with `python -m pytest -q`.
